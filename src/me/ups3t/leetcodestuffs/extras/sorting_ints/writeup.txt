Explanation:
    Both methods in the SortingIntegers.java class are using bubble sort, where the lowest numbers "bubble up" to the left as they are swapped during iteration.
    I'm not sure which one is faster, I'd argue that sortingIntegers1 is the fastest one since it will stop iteration as soon as the integers in the
    array are properly sorted.
