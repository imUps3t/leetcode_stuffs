>.< I actually stole the mode solution from the internet because my brain is slowly shrinking by the minute..

Explanation:
    Median:
        In a array of numbers with an odd size, the median is the lower half of the array size divided by two, which always happens to ints. I subtract by 1 becaus arrays start with
        0, and you'd end up with a median an index over without it.

        In an array of numbers with a even size, you must add the two numbers in the middle (in an array of 8, it would be 4 and 5, since the other numbers on each side would be the same amount)
        and divide by 2.
    Mode:
        All we do is perform a 2D for-loop over the array provided, and count the size for each.
        At the end of the iteration, if the count for the current integer in the index is larger the current largest, it is now set as the largest,
        and iteration continues towards the end.
    Mean:
        Mean was incredibly simple.
        We do a for loop to get the sum of every single int added together, then divide by its size.
    Range:
        First we use our sorting algorithm to sort it from least to greatest, making it easier for us to find the largest value and the lowest.
        We then subtract the largest value by the lowest (the top from the bottom, since it is sorted.)
