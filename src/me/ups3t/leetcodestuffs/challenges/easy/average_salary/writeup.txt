Instructions:
    Given an array of unique integers salary where salary[i] is the salary of the employee i.

    Return the average salary of employees excluding the minimum and maximum salary.
Notes:
    I saw a solution after submitting that discussed using Arrays.sort, but that would probably take too much space. My
    code took up 500b less than his anyway, so we're good!
Explanation:
    First, we get the min and max of our current array. The reason we need to obtain these is so later we can make a
    if check that the current index is NOT equal to the current max.

    Then, we add everything that isn't the minimum and maximum numbers, and divide by the length - 2.

    The cause for us subtracting to is because the min and max are two numbers that we are not including.

    Adding up all numbers of an array and dividing by the length is called the mean.
