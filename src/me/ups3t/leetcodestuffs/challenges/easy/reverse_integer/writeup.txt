Instructions
    Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

    Note:
    Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
Explanation
    First, we reverse the string,
    then we strip hyphens to avoid the minus sign being on the far right.
    Then, if a hyphen existed in the original number, we add it to the start after reversing.

    We add a try catch around the function to avoid integer overflows (over 32 bit digits.)
