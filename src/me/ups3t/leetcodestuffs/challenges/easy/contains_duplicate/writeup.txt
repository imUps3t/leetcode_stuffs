Instructions:
    Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates.

    Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and it should return false if every element is distinct.
Explanation:
    I had a realization: sorting.
    In a sorted array, equal numbers will be stored next to each other.
    After reaching every number, we check if the number beside it is equal to the current one, there is a duplicate, and we return true.
    If after iterating it reaches the bottom of the function, that means there are no duplicates, and we can safely return false.
Notes:
    In the leetcode testcase this took 3ms, faster than 99.70% of all submissions (yay! ^.^)
