Instructions:
    Given an array arr of integers, check if there exists two integers N and M such that N is the double of M ( i.e. N = 2 * M).

    More formally check if there exists two indices i and j such that :

        i != j
        0 <= i, j < arr.length
        arr[i] == 2 * arr[j]
Explanation:
    We do a 2D iteration of the arr array.
    In the first loop, we do another loop to see if the current number the index points to is equal to the current nested iteration doubled.
    The reason we make a check to make sure i != j is because numbers that, multiplied by 2, still equal itself (like
    0.)
