Instructions:
    Implement function ToLowerCase() that has a string parameter str, and returns the same string in lowercase.

Explanation:
    You might be wondering "why the hell are they asking to convert a string to lowercase? almost every high level language has it"
    I actually have no idea why, but it's probably because they wanted you to figure out a way yourself.

    I came up with a simple solution that isn't str.toLowerCase();

    First, we check if the number is alphabetic and is not uppercase first.

    Then, we perform a for loop on each member of the string.

    Every uppercase letter's lowercase ASCII code is 32 more than the uppercase one.
    So we simply add 32 to each char code and append it to the new string, and return after iteration is complete.
